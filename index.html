    <p>Physical capability refers to an individual’s capacity to undertake the physical tasks of daily living. It can be assessed in a number of ways including objectively using tests of muscle strength and physical performance and by self reports of everyday function.</p>
    <p>In the NSHD, muscle strength has been assessed through measurement of grip strength, and physical performance has been measured using standing balance and chair rise tests. In addition, study members’ self reports of their ability to perform everyday daily functions including being able to wash and dress oneself, go shopping and cook have also been assessed.</p>
